# Learning a plan by asking questions

The aim of this research effort is to extend the work by [Branavan et al. (2012)](http://people.csail.mit.edu/regina/my_papers/planning12.pdf). Our work will introduce the actions of asking questions as part of the agent planning process.

## Run

This assumes you have `docker` installed on your machine.

```
$ sh ./start.sh
```
